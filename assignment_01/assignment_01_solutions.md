## Exercise 1

### Tasks
#### Study how to submit jobs in SGE, how to check their state and how to cancel them.

- <code>qsub name_of_script</code> is used to submit jobs where name_of_script represents the path to  a simple shell script containing the commands to be run on the remote cluster nodes.
- <code>qstat</code> to get information about running or waiting jobs 
- <code>qdel job-id</code> to delete a job (terminates application, frees up resources)


#### Prepare a submission script that starts an arbitrary executable, e.g. `/bin/hostname`
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# Execute job in the queue "std.q" unless you have special requirements. 
#$ -q std.q
# The batch system should use the current directory as working directory. 
#$ -cwd
# Name your job. Unless you use the -o and -e options, output will 
# go to a unique file name.o<job_id> for each job.
#$ -N my_test_job
# Redirect output stream to this file.
#$ -o output.dat
# Join the error stream to the output stream.
#$ -j yes
# Specify parallel environment (list available ones with qconf â€“spl) 
#$ -pe openmpi-2perhost 8
/bin/hostname
</code></pre>

#### In your opionion, what are the 5 most important parameters available when submitting a job and why? What are possible settings of these parameters, and what effect do they have?
#### How do you run your program in parallel? What environment setup is required?
